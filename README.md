## Trading Bot implementation

Our goal for this project is to implement a stock trading bot which is capable of making intelligent decisions that increases the overall profit at a given time. We plan to implement and compare the results of three different techniques namely,  Deep Q-Learning, Double Deep Q-Learning, and Actor -Critic method.
